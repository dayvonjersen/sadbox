TODO
====
- Simplify NumberNode: split it into FloatNode and IntNode. Support
  only decimal int and decimal/hexadecimal float, like Closure.
  Drop support for complex and uint.
- All errors must inform filename when available, that is, for all
  templates parsed using ParseFiles() or ParseGlob().
- All parsing/execution errors must also inform accurate line and
  column numbers where the error occurred.
